# Department of Cultural Affairs - Neighborhood Arts Profile + Cultural Activity Analysis

## About

The City of Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs (DCA) is currently developing the Neighborhood Arts Profile, a research tool that assesses arts and cultural vibrancy in each of the City’s 200+ neighborhoods. With this tool, we will identify "arts deserts," locating areas of concentration and scarcity of infrastructural support for cultural assets and activities, alongside community wellbeing indicators. This pursuit of neighborhood-level insights will inform our place-based strategy toward building city-wide community vibrancy.

As a part of the Neighborhood Arts Profile, we would like to develop a data extraction and analytic model to map LA’s cultural activities. Working with a DSF partner, we plan to: 1) implement webscraping methodology to extract and aggregate existing cultural activities data sources made available through events curation apps and websites including[ DiscoverLA](https://www.discoverlosangeles.com/),[ CurateLA](http://curate.la/),[ ForYourArt](http://foryourart.com/),[ The CultureList](http://theculturelist.org/),[ Sea Saw](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/see-saw-gallery-guide/id791643418?mt=8),[ 5 Everyday](https://5everyday.com/), [Los Angeles Public Library Calendar](http://www.lapl.org/whats-on/calendar), and[ DCA’s events](http://culturela.org/events/) API (to be launched in winter, 2018); 2) create an analytic model to index events data as a means to assess cultural vibrancy across Los Angeles neighborhoods.



This analysis will be eventually be integrated into the cultural asset analysis that is being developed and prototyped in fall 2017/winter 18.
